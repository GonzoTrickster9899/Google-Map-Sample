# Flutter: Google Map Sample

The widget/feature of Flutter that can only be viewed and magnified on Google Maps (for the first time!)

Note: I'm just sharing the knowledge about Flutter because of the change dynamically from new updates of Dart Programming Language, Flutter Framework, and the packages. You can use it for educational and development purposes only.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application and development stage.

1. Clone this repository and open it in the editor (e.g. VS Code).
2. Run in main.dart and see the application of Google Maps.
3. The features only viewing and magnifying

   For those wondering why the Google Map shows there is no API key, this API key is actually from my Google Map Platform Account. You can get an API key on your account.

Lastly, you can add or pivot this feature/widget to this app in many ways, like making your personal location on your map, making routes, displaying the destination, and more. Also, available the Andriod, iOS and web version. Here's the link to the [Google Maps Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps) and its [documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation).

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
